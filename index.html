            <h1>Cyclical Carpet Initiative Program Overview</h1>

            <p>For the benefit of our investors and property management professionals, Boyd Watterson Asset Management LLC is implementing a National Cyclical Carpet Initiative.</p>

            <p>The teaming agreement, covering both material and installation, has been reached with Milliken Flooring and will be administered by Occupied flooring Solutions (OFS).</p>

            <p>Material options include Milliken&rsquo;s Remix Remastered Trimline &amp; Free Flow collections. The two collections provide 24 different patterns and over 300 Colorways. Remix Remastered also includes accent options in 12 colors as part of the collection. Both options are standard with non-PVC cushion backing. Aside from increased comfort underfoot and acoustics, the backing virtually eliminates floor prep associated with preexisting adhesives.</p>

            <p>Implementation is as simple as a phone call or email to Occupied Flooring Solutions at <a href="tel:410-494-7395">(410)&nbsp;494&#8209;7395</a> or <a href="mailto:mcostas@ofsllc.net">mcostas@ofsllc.net</a>. The initial consultation will identify the particulars of your project, focusing on the timeframe, the facility, and tenant requirements. Following the initial consultation, a site visit will be coordinated to provide an in-depth project review and implementation path tailored to your project&rsquo;s specific needs.</p>

            <p>Sampling of the two collections is available through OFS or the Boyd Watterson/ Milliken Portal. For a more personal approach and assistance in coordination to existing finishes, contact Melissa Heater of Milliken at <a href="tel:443-504-9965">(443)&nbsp;504&#8209;9965</a> (<a href="mailto:melissa.heeter@imilliken.com">melissa.heeter@imilliken.com</a>). Melissa can also help with digital rendering options of your facility and collection selections.</p>

            <p>You can expect the installation process to be non-disruptive to the tenants. Installation is generally off hour, with computers, phones and the bulk of tenant&rsquo;s contents left in place. The minimal amount of preparation is detailed on our orientation sheet. On average, you can expect a production rate of 10,000 SF per week. The project is &ldquo;phased&rdquo; and documented well in advance of the project&rsquo;s start.</p>
